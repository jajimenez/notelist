# Notelist
Notelist is a tag based note taking REST API that can be used to manage
notebooks, tags and notes. Notelist is written in Python and is based on the
Flask framework.

## How to install

It's recommended to install Notelist in a Python **virtual environment**. To
create a virtual environment and activate it (in Linux or Mac OS), you can use
the `venv` Python module and the `source` command:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then Notelist can be downloaded from the **PyPI** repository and installed with
**PIP**:

```
pip install notelist
```

Alternatively, you can generate the **built package** or the **source archive**
from the source code and install any of them. To generate and install the
**built package** (preferred):

```
pip install wheel
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install ./dist/notelist*.whl
```

To generate and install the **source archive**:

```
python setup.py sdist
pip install ./dist/notelist*.tar.gz
```

## How to run

To run Notelist, we need first to set the following environment variables:

- `FLASK_APP`:<br>
Its value must be always the Notelist package name: `notelist`.

- `NOTELIST_SECRET_KEY`:<br>
Its value must be a **random** sequence of characters
and must be kept **secret**. E.g. `f34jgU#vcfk6&(759fg!AFj`.

- `NOTELIST_DB_URI`:<br>
Its value is the database connection string. E.g.
`sqlite:///path_to_database_file`. For certain database systems, you might need
to install additional Python packages (e.g. **Psycopg** for **PostgreSQL**)

To create the database tables:

```
flask db upgrade -d $(flask path migrations)
```

To create a user:

```
flask user create <username> <password> <admin> <enabled> <full-name> <e-mail> 
```

- admin = `0` (default) or `1`
- enabled = `0` (default) or `1` (if value is 0, the user won't be able to log in)
- Example for an administrator user: `flask user create admin somepassword 1 1`

To run Notelist (only in **development** or **test** environments):

```
flask run
```

To run Notelist in a **production** environment, we need to run it through a
**WSGI** server (e.g. Gunicorn). We can install **Gunicorn** from the
`requirements_pro.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements_pro.txt
```

And then we can run Notelist through Gunicorn (for instance, with 4 worker
processes, listening to connections from outside our computer on port 5000):

```
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 notelist:app
```

## How to run with Docker

You can run a Docker container with Notelist with the following command, which
downloads the Docker image from the Docker Hub repository (if the image doesn't
exist yet locally) and runs a container from the image:

```
docker container run --name notelist -d -p 5000:5000 -e NOTELIST_SECRET_KEY=<key> -e NOTELIST_DB_URI=<uri> jajim/notelist:0.2.0
```

Once the container is running, we can create the database tables with this
command:

```
docker container exec -it notelist upgrade-db
```

To create an administrator user:

```
docker container exec -it notelist create-user <username> <password> <admin> <enabled> <name> <email>
```

- admin: `0` (default) or `1`
- enabled: `0` (default) or `1` (if it's 0, the user won't be able to log in)
- To create an administrator user: `docker container exec -it notelist
create-user admin pw_example 1 1`

## How to run with Docker Compose

We can try Notelist using **Docker Compose** to run a Notelist container and a
PostgreSQL container to store the Notelist data. Create a file named
`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  notelist-api:
    image: jajim/notelist:0.2.0
    container_name: notelist-api
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - NOTELIST_SECRET_KEY=aSecretKey
      - NOTELIST_DB_URI=postgresql://notelist:somepw@notelist-db:5432/notelist

  notelist-db:
    image: postgres:13.3
    container_name: notelist-db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=notelist
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=somepw
      - POSTGRES_DB=notelist
```

Run the containers from the same directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Create the database tables:

```
docker container exec -it notelist-api upgrade-db
```

Create an administrator user:

```
docker container exec -it notelist-api create-user admin somepassword 1 1
```

## How to run the unit tests

To run all the unit tests, run the following command from the project's root
directory:

```
python -m unittest discover test
```

## Usage examples

The following are some examples of how to make requests to the Notelist API
(assuming it's running on our local computer and listening on port 5000) from
Python code using the external Python library `requests`. You can install this
library from PyPI with PIP:

```
pip install requests
```

Log in:

```python
import requests

data = {"username": "someuser", "password": "somepassword"}
r = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/login", json=data)
result = r.json()["result"]

access_token = result["access_token"]
refresh_token = result["refresh_token"]
```

Create a notebook:

```python
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
data = {"name": "Work"}
r = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/notebook", headers=headers, json=data)

notebook_id = r.json()["result"]["id"]
```

Create a note:

```python
# By default, new notes are "active" (i.e. their "active" property is True).
data = {
  "notebook_id": notebook_id,
  "title": "Test note",
  "body": "This is a test note.",
  "tags": ["Test", "Important"]}

r = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/note", headers=headers, json=data)
note_id = r.json()["result"]["id"]
```

Get all the notebook's notes by a given filter:

```python
data = {
  "active": True,                 # Only active notes
  "tags": ["Test", "Important"],  # Only notes that have any of these tags
  "no_tags": True,                # Include notes without tags as well
  "last_mod": True,               # Order notes by Last Modified timestamp
  "asc": True}                    # Ascending order

r = requests.post(f"http://localhost:5000/notes/{notebook_id}", headers=headers, json=data)
notes = r.json()["result"]
```

Search for notebooks, tags and notes that match a given text:

```python
# Search for items that match "test"
r = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/search/test", headers=headers)
result = r.json()["result"]

notebooks = result["notebooks"]
tags = result["tags"]
notes = result["notes"]
```

Archive a note:

```python
data = {"active": False}
r = requests.put(f"http://localhost:5000/note/{note_id}", headers=headers, json=data)
```

Log out:

```python
r = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/logout", headers=headers)
```
